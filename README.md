# SimplePacmanClone
My name is Brett Rietveld. I enjoy programming. I built some clone arcade games so I could put them into my homemade arcade system!
You are welcome to take my code and imporve it or use it or do whatever you want with it! Pacman was the first of 3 games I recreated.

I use sfml. so you must make sure if you try to take my source code you set up you libraries and dependent things to have SFML.
