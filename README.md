# SimplePacmanClone
My name is Brett Rietveld. I enjoy programming a bit. i built some clone arcade games so i could put them into my homemade arcade system!
You are welcome to take my code and imporve it or use it or do whatever you want with it! Pacman was the first of 3 games i tried to copy.

I use sfml. so you must make sure if you try to take my source code you set up you libraries and dependent things to have SFML.

I used  visual studio 2015, and i followed a tutoria on youtube for how to set up sfml on visual studio and it worked for me.
this is my first time putting code on GitHub so i am still not sure what standard practice is as far as this readme is concerned. 
But try messaging me if you have any issues! and thanks for checking out my project!
